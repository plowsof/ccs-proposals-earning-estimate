Heyo everyone. Welcome back to another edition of "rehrar asks for money to do Monero related things". In this episode, rehrar wants to go back to C3. So I guess this one is called rehrar to C3 2: Return of Jafar.

Basically, similar to last year, I want to go help at 36C3. Last year I was the MC, did general coordination, and helped to run the floor and speeches, as well as giving a few speeches on my own.

The costs to send me to Leipzig is as follows:

Flight	1700

Hotel	630

Incidentals	565

Ticket	140

For a total of 3035. 

Converted to XMR (With a 10% buffer):
58.65 XMR.

IF the community thinks I would be of value to go to C3, then let's get this tagged and bagged. Thanks all!
