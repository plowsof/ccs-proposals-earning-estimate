# What

Tasks:

- Daily: search, curate, structure and post new reports/stories
- Daily/As Needed: post new *MO Community Messages*

- Monthly: publish the *MO Blitz Report* (includes everything that happened the previous month)
- As Needed: housekeeping (revise stories to make sure links and content is still relevant)
- As Needed: outreach (engage with the community on Matrix, Reddit, XMPP, emails)
- As Needed: make sure the website is live and working as expected (no 404's, domain is paid, etc)
- Optional: add new features, improvements and website sections

# Who

escapethe3RA, I have started contributing to the Monero ecosystem in August with Monero Observer and other smaller projects:

- published 11 MO XMR TA reports (https://www.monero.observer/tag/blitz)
- published 3 MO Blitz reports (https://www.monero.observer/tag/analysis)
- created several guides on GPG encryption, RSS feeds and Monero contributors (https://www.monero.observer/ultimate-guide-new-monero-contributors/, https://www.monero.observer/gpg-cleartext-signatures/, https://www.monero.observer/gpg-generate-full-keypair/)
- redesigned *Monero Means Money* website, donated bounty to GF (https://moneromeans.money/, https://github.com/escapethe3RA/monero-means-money/)

# Proposal

I will work for 25 hours per week over 3 months at a rate of 0.07 XMR / hour. At $220 / XMR (10% buffer) this makes 21 XMR (0.07*100*3).
