## What

- Smaller dev work on CLI and GUI
  - Some ideas I want to work on
    - Update monero unbound submodule to upstream (CLI)
    - Set up a depends package source backup (CLI)
    - Fix clang warnings (CLI)
    - Set minimum Qt version to 5.12, cleanup codebase and cmake file (GUI)
    - Fix small design inconsistencies (GUI)
  - Put effort where necessary
- Testing and reviewing pull requests (CLI, GUI, site)
- Monero release engineering for CLI and GUI
  - Organizing what goes into a release
  - Compiling CLI and GUI, packaging for distribution
  - Writing release notes
- Misc work (user support, issue tracker maintanace)

## Who

selsta, I have been contributing to monero since around 2018 with over 340 merged commits. Here is a list of my previous work:

- CLI contributions: https://github.com/monero-project/monero/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aselsta
- GUI contributions: https://github.com/monero-project/monero-gui/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aselsta

If funded I will provide monthly updates in the CCS comment section.

## Proposal

Work for 30 hours per week over the next 3 months (from Mid April to Mid June) at a rate of 45€ / hour. At 212€ / XMR (14 day EMA) this makes 76 XMR.
