## Intro

Hi all, I [closed out](https://repo.getmonero.org/monero-project/ccs-proposals/-/merge_requests/338#note_20190) my previous [Seraphis Library Work CCS](https://repo.getmonero.org/monero-project/ccs-proposals/-/merge_requests/338) after consuming all the hours. There are additional tasks I would like to work on. For background on this CCS, please see the links in the previous sentence.

In the previous CCS I finished adding new things to the seraphis library, and from here on mainly have cleanup tasks left.


## Continuing work

Here are the tasks I hope to finish by the end of this CCS.

- Complete the 'final draft' of my seraphis library (finish my cleanup and review pass).
- Update the [Seraphis paper draft](https://github.com/UkoeHB/Seraphis).

This CCS should be a long-term one, with intermittent hours spent on miscellaneous Monero R&D tasks and working with Monero devs on seraphis library reviews and PRs. I may also update the seraphis library to replace BP+2 with BP++ at some point.
