Hi,

After a hiatus, I'm back for more monero work.

This will be part time again, and with a main goal of working on mitigations for various attempts at abusing the network
(which I've started working on already in the last couple weeks or so) including PoW on connect. Possibly also helping
sarang plug his implementation of Bulletproofs++ into Monero consensus, if he does not do it himself. And the usual bits
and bobs as always.

Here's the link to my previous CCS: https://repo.getmonero.org/monero-project/ccs-proposals/-/merge_requests/103

With the usual rate of $30 + 0.2 monero per hour, and monero at $130 currently, we get 225 monero for three months
(which will be more than three calendar months, since part time, how much more depends on how I divide my time between
monero and other things). As before, I'll post monthly updates regardless of how much time I actually spent on Monero
that month.

Thanks
