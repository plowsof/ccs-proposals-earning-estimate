I'm proposing to continue my part time work on Getmonero.org (monero-site repository), 20 hours a week for 3 more months.

## What
I will work on the website in the same terms as in [my last proposal](https://ccs.getmonero.org/proposals/erciccione-website1.html), so basically:

- Triaging issues
- Adding new functionalities according to the feedback of the community
- Increasing user friendliness
- Updating obsolete sections
- Improving localization process
- Bug fixes
- Reviews

I triage or review the vast majority of the [issues](https://github.com/monero-project/monero-site/issues) and merge requests on the monero-site repository. You can also see the list of my [past direct contributions](https://github.com/monero-project/monero-site/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aerciccione) to have an idea of the work i do. I usually post updates about the website on reddit as well (see [the last one](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/h86mof/getmoneroorg_updated_1_new_user_guide_1/)).

## Milestones
I'm proposing to work as developer on the monero-site repository for three months at a rate of â‚¬30/hour, starting on July 11th 2020, 20 hours a week.

Update: I was unable to start working on this CCS on July 1st as planned, instead my work will start on July 11th. As a result, all milestones should be considered complete on the 11th of each month. This CCS will be completed on October 11th instead of September 30th.
