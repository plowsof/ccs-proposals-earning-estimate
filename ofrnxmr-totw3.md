Welcome back. Hopefully I still have your ear.

I'd like to take a moment to express gratitude towards all of my anonymous supporters. I see you, and I thank you for everything you've helped me with thus far. I wouldn't be here without you. If this proposal is merged, I will likely be good through til 2026.

This may not seem as abnormal as I'd have liked. The title is what it is, but the proposal is intended to cover contributions to Monero proper. It was requested that I open a new MR instead of editing the [old one](https://repo.getmonero.org/monero-project/ccs-proposals/-/merge_requests/444).

- 14xmr/mth includes 20-25hrs/wk on customer support, docs, site, ccs, assisting devs, and attempting to take over the world:
  - 3xmr/mth work with core devs, community devs, researchers, and other contributors to test or advise on features, issues, community projects etc.
  - 3xmr/mth #monero-support: Lead the support channel & provide hands on support to users
  - 3xmr/mth #monero-docs: Maintain¹ (or help to maintain) monero-docs repo and/or assist plowsof, 321bob321 and others with content
  - 2xmr/mth #monero-site: Maintain¹ (or help to maintain) monero-site repo and/or assist plowsof, hardenedsteel and others with content
  - 2xmr/mth #monero-community: Assisting CCS proposers (and plowsof) with relations/logistics
  - 1xmr/mth take over the world: dedicate time to dealing with "meta" stuff. There is quite a bit of unfinished business (on and off repo) that needs to be tackled
  - donate to others

The above amounts are estimates. Actual distribution may vary.

¹ Maintain = handle merges

Terms:
- 12 Months @ 168xmr total
- Estimated 20-25 hr/wk

Rate:
- 1 XMR = 1 XMR

Payout structure: 
- 12 monthly milestones
