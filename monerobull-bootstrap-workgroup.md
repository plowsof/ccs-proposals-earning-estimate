# Who, what, when, where?

Hi, I'm monerobull. I run monero.town & monerosupplies.com. I also never did any paid work for Monero before.

I was recently mentioned in a CCS proposal by geonic, famous Monero movie director. There's a lot of opportunity for improvement in the non-dev areas of the project, and not always enough hands to get it done. It was agreed upon that, were this to happen, this would be done through my own CCS proposal rather than through geonics. This moves me from being accountable to nobody, to accountable to the community.

A quick summary of what I'd be working on:
- Setting up / managing a Monero Website Workgroup, keep it up to date (our roadmap still mentions triptych)
- Joining the moderator teams for Matrix and helping along with discord
- Being a supportive figure in the Monero Community workgroup and helping that along as needed
- Keeping a finger on the "pulse of the community" in the various chat rooms and platforms (Telegram, Discord, not IRC, Matrix, Reddit, etc.)
- Aiding and assisting in event work as needed (part of Monerokon team since MK3)

# Why?
There's lots of non-dev stuff to do, and not so many people to do it. I am mostly capable and willing.

# How long? How much?

30 XMR for three months for half time work. Possibility of renewal depending on community sentiment.

# Deliverables
I will do all of the above in the beginning section, and give a monthly report to the community on what's been done, and tasks accomplished. Luigi does a lot of work, I'd like to take on some of that.

# COI
I would have never made this proposal without geonics preceding yolo proposal. In the past I've tried to stay away from the CCS due to all the drama surrounding it. This very proposal was born out of CCS drama.
