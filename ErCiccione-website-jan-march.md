I'm proposing to work on Getmonero part time, 20 hours a week. [My last proposal](https://repo.getmonero.org/monero-project/ccs-proposals/merge_requests/101) was project-based, meaning that the proposal was considered completed after all the issues mentioned were resolved. This time i'm suggesting a more "usual" approach: part time work for three months.

## What
My intention is to work on the website in a more consistent way. My last proposal made me realize that there is so much work to do and a project-based approach is not sufficient. Getmonero needs some constant and dedicated attention. You can check [my activity on the monero-site repository](https://repo.getmonero.org/users/erciccione/activity) for an idea of my past contributions, but summarized, my activity will be:

- Triaging issues
- Adding new functionalities according to the feedback of the community
- Increasing user friendliness
- Updating obsolete sections
- Improving localization process
- Reviews

## Milestones
I'm asking to work as developer on the monero-site repository for three months at a rate of €30/hour, starting on January 2020, 20 hours a week. This results in a total of *174 XMR* at the rate 1 XMR = €41.
