This is a proposal to translate the core part of the website (7615 words), navigation menu (147 words), footer 1 (142 words) & 
footer 2 (5 words) to Norwegian, amounting to 7909 words. I think that those Norwegians who are not as sturdy in English will 
appreciate being able to learn what Monero is about in their native language. I would like to help facilitate this and to 
make sure they understand Monero better by providing a solid translation.

About one month ago I translated the GUI wallet to Norwegian. I spent quite some time on this translation as I 
wanted everything to be right, and it seems that the reviewers were pleased with my work. I previously asked for 
3 XMR to translate the GUI wallet (3489 words). Given the same XMR/word ratio, this equates to just below 7 XMR.

To compensate for values that should not have been counted in my text editor, I suggest deducting 1 XMR for this, so I 
ask for a final amount of 6 XMR. The translation will consist of one milestone â€“ the translation of all 7909 words. I will translate 
the content and I expect to use 3-4 days on translating this.
