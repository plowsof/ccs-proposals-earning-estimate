# About this Proposal

Translation of the [GUI Wallet](https://translate.getmonero.org/projects/monero/gui-wallet/), [monero-site](https://translate.getmonero.org/projects/getmonero/monero-site/), [Monero Means Money (subtitles)](https://translate.getmonero.org/projects/community/monero-means-money/) and [Sound Money, Safe Mode (subtitles)](https://translate.getmonero.org/projects/community/sound-money-safe-mode-subtitles/) to Polish.

# About Me

Hey, I'm Paul Janowitz and have been around in the Bitcoin space from 2012, came into Monero in 2016, some will recognise me from Twitter, Reddit, IRC or moderating the Telegram groups (where I had to step down unfortunately due to lack of time).

I have already contributed lots of translations into Polish and German (where I'm both native speaker) on the old system and also on Weblate in my free time whenever possible. The GUI translation into Polish doesn't need much work any more, but the website still does. If the proposal will not get fully funded, I will proceed according to the milestones listed below, since the subtitles are a nice to have but I don't see them as crucial like the GUI and website.

I am submitting this proposal since I think to bring both the experience and already have proven to be willing to contribute my time to the project.
