### Proposal closed

The remaining funds (36XMR) have been absorbed by https://ccs.getmonero.org/proposals/VOSTOEMISIO-Continuation-of-Core-Monero-Concepts-A-Series-of-Animated-Explainers.html

Hello guys,

It's savandra, who created animated explainer videos,

here's a link to our channel.

I contacted u/dsmlegend, https://www.reddit.com/u/dsmlegend/ and he developed an awesome draft of probably anything should be covered on the topic (though it's a bit business-focused).

Here's a link to the document https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnjUpT9gGxyQ_lud7uKoTCg

I'd like to add, that since then, we improved on the animations a lot and we hope Monero will benefit from it!


Our proposal is to be billed per minute of the animation, which covers:

script development ( with implementing all the feedback from the community)

illustrations development

animations

voice-over

sound effects

Considering the above, I think $400 per minute of the animation should work out nicely.
Also, it's been a while since the last video, so let me know if there are any updates on how the pitch should be handled.

It is expected to complete one video a month
An expiration date for the proposal: June, 7
