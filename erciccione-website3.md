I'm proposing to continue my part time work on Getmonero.org (monero-site repository), 20 hours a week for 3 more months.

## What
I will work on the website in the same terms as in [my last proposal](https://ccs.getmonero.org/proposals/erciccione-website2.html), so basically:

- Triaging issues
- Adding new functionalities according to the feedback of the community
- Increasing user friendliness
- Updating obsolete sections
- Improving localization process
- Bug fixes
- Reviews

I triage or review the vast majority of the [issues](https://github.com/monero-project/monero-site/issues) and merge requests on the monero-site repository. You can also see the list of my [past direct contributions](https://github.com/monero-project/monero-site/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aerciccione) to have an idea of the work i do. I usually post updates about the website on reddit as well (see [the last one](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/iufpc3/getmoneroorg_updated_new_blog_posts_improved/)).

## Milestones
I'm proposing to work as developer on the monero-site repository for three months at a rate of €30/hour, starting on October 11th 2020, 20 hours a week. This results in a total of 85 XMR at the rate 1 XMR == €78 (10% buffer from current price).
