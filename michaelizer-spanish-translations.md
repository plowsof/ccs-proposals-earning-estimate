## What the proposal is about?

Translation into Spanish of the following video subtitles: [Monero Means Money](https://translate.getmonero.org/projects/community/monero-means-money/) and [Sound Money, Safe Mode](https://translate.getmonero.org/projects/community/sound-money-safe-mode-subtitles/)


## Who will complete the proposal?

My name is Miguel Medina, I'm 26 years old Venezuelan studying Software Engeenering and a crypto enthusiast since 2017's boom and have been contributing to blokchain projects since then (as a translator), I worked as part of the translation team in a Community-led project named Utopian on [Steemit](https://steemit.com/@michaelizer), where I translated for several blockchain projects and tech projects of other nature. Also worked as part of the translation team for the [Rchain Cooperative](https://rchain.coop/).


## Why it is important for Monero and the community?

Spanish is the official language of 21 countries, is spoken by more than 500 million people around the world, the Spanish community in crypto is rapidly growing and those countries are adopting cryptocurrencies faster than others due to poor governance and payment limitations. I believe having this information translated into Spanish is very important (even more in these current period of time when blockchain is getting a lot of attention) to spread awareness of Monero through those communities.
