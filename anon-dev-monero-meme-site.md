My proposal is to develop, design, market, host, and maintain a website for Monero memes. Meme creators will be able to get tips for their hard work. Meme creators will finally be able to quit their jobs and meme full time. The project will be open source and full of memes.

I will complete the proposal. I love Monero and wants to help get it the recognition it deserves. I have 10 years of development experience (including blockchain) and have experience in marketing.

This project is very important to the community because it will increase memes. Memes help Monero with marketing and reaching new audiences. Creators of Monero memes will be able to get paid which will incentivize them to make more memes. Monero is the best project in the space but the marketing could be better.

My milestones are simple. I am asking for 5 XMR once the website is live and project has been completed. I am then asking for the last 5 XMR once 50 memes (original content, not old) have been posted by users.

I am asking for an expiration date of October 15th. The development should take me 1-2 weeks to complete and getting the first 50 posts should take a few months maximum (Hopefully a lot faster).
