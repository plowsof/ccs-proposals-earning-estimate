## What

Hi, everyone! I am rating89us and this is my first CCS proposal. I have been doing voluntary (unpaid) contributions to Monero GUI on my free time since 2020, adding new UI elements, improving UX and fixing bugs. While Monero GUI has improved a lot during the last years, there is still a lot of work to be done. I'm really motivated in making Monero GUI easy to use by anyone.

Some things I want to work on:
-	General: add tooltips where still necessary, improve displaying of wallet > accounts hierarchy, discreet mode (hide amounts/balances on all pages); implement tip of the day popup; implement user onboarding popups when the wallet is opened for the first time
-	LeftPanel: redesign synchronization progress bars, Socks5 proxy/TOR icon
- Send: display "All" amount as a label with close button
-	Address book: user avatars, sorting
-	Transactions: amount filtering, sent/received filtering, historical fiat price
-	Settings: create a dedicated page to synchronization process, redesign Node page, add "change restore height" menu item
-	Merchant: redesign merchant page, UI/UX for tablets/smartphones
-	Wizard: redesign hardware wallet page, create a dedicated page to seed and restore height
-	Accessibility: add description/navigation for UI elements (support screen readers for visually impaired users)
-	White theme: improve color contrast of UI elements
-	Upgrade FontAwesome icons to last version
-	Android: test and improve UI/UX for tablets/smartphones
-	Test and review UI/UX pull requests
-	Update text and screenshots of Monero GUI guides (pdf guide and getmonero.org user guides)

## Who

rating89us, I have been contributing voluntarily to Monero GUI since 2020 with over 77 merged commits. 

Here is a list of my previous merged commits on Monero GUI:
- Pull requests: https://github.com/monero-project/monero-gui/pulls?page=1&q=is%3Apr+author%3Arating89us+is%3Aclosed

If funded I will provide monthly updates in the CCS comment section.

## Proposal

Work for 20 hours per week over the next 3 months (from Mid July to Mid October) at a rate of 38€/hour. At 188.75€/XMR on Kraken (14-day EMA) this makes 48.31 XMR.
