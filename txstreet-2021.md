Hello! My name is Tom and I run txstreet.com. (Proof - http://out.txstreet.com/getmonero). I was recommended the CCS by a member of the Monero community to fund the addition of Monero to TxStreet. Because the website remains closed source for now, this proposal will be framed as an advertising campaign.
​

I have reduced the funding to the minimum amount of what I think is necessary for Monero to remain operational on the website. I do not want to make any profit off of the CCS.
​
# What is TxStreet?
TxStreet.com is a live cryptocurrency transaction visualizer featuring Bitcoin, Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash. When a new transaction is broadcasted to a cryptocurrency, a person appears and attempts to board a bus. If the transaction has a high enough fee, they will board the first bus and be ready to be included in the next mined block. If there are too many transactions to be included in the next block, and the transaction didn't pay a high enough fee, the person will either wait in line or board a different bus. Consecutive buses will appear when there are enough transactions to fill them.
​

TxStreet has become popular in other crypto communites, here are some examples of people talking about it:

​

Traffic estimate is 200k - 300k unique visitors per month based off of fathom showing 110k UV in the last month and cloudflare showing 650k UV in the last month. Fathom can be blocked client side by adblockers and cloudflare includes traffic from bots, which is why there is a large discrepancy.

# How Monero will be presented
Monero will have it's own street just like the other supported coins.
​
Live stats that will be shown:
- Broadcasted Tx/Sec (Past 5 mins)
- Confirmed Tx/Sec (Past hour)
- Mempool Size (Bytes)
- Mempool Count
- Median Fee (USD)
- Median Fee (Atomic units per byte)
- Bytes/Second (Past 5 mins)
- Ciruclating Supply
- Price (USD)
- Last Block
- Median Txs Per Block (Past Hour)
- Blockchain Size
- Difficulty
- Block Size Limit (Current)
- Median Block Size (Past Hour)
- Average Block Time (Past 250 Blocks)
- Market Cap (USD)
- 24 Hour Volume (USD)
​

The coins that TxStreet currently supports have no privacy by default, so it is possible to parse the data from transactions and categorize them into "houses". Since Monero has strong privacy and all of the information from each transaction is hidden (besides fee, size etc.), there will be no need for the houses and that section can be removed completely. Or if the community prefers, it can be replaced with something else.
​

To further convey the message of privacy, every "person" (transaction) will be an identical sprite. I have been suggested "Monero Memeball" or "Isabella Monero Girl" for the sprite. Initially I wanted to do a black trench coat, but was informed that there is a stigma towards that. The final decision will be "Monero Memeball" unless the community has feedback on this.

​

When completed, the Monero street will be viewable here: https://txstreet.com/v/xmr
Alongside bitcoin, it will be viewable here: https://txstreet.com/v/xmr-btc
​

To get to the Monero street, users can click the dropdown in the top left/right of other streets. For the first month, a large notification will show once for each user saying "New Street! View Monero".
​
# Cost breakdown
​
## Milestone 1 - Monero street complete and live
20 XMR. I estimate it will take 1-2 months to complete. 
​
## Milestones 2-5 - Additional 3 months of advertising
2.5 XMR  for server costs. ($120/month base estimate)

2 XMR for maintenance.
​

This proposal is for 1 year of advertising. After 1 year, another proposal will be submitted for additional funding. If funding is not met, the operational costs of the Monero street will have to be paid for by me and the Monero street will be subject to removal if I can't cover those costs.
