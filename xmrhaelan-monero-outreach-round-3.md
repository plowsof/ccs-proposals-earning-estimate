A big thanks again to everyone who supported Round 2 of funding for Monero Outreach! Final report can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/bonpt3/monero_outreach_round_2_ccs_final_report_see_what/). 
We have made significant progress in our ability to support and enhance the outreach efforts of the Monero Community, and are beginning to receive requests for support from various areas of the Monero ecosystem. We are honored to be able to support Monero in this way, and we look forward even more to what is ahead!

Below is a breakdown of what we intend to work on for Round 3. Please note the Ongoing Project Tasks that we are working on now, during, and in between our CCS proposals. We have continued to volunteer on this important endeavor in between proposals.

# WHO:

#### Monero Outreach 

We are a workgroup of creators, writers, technicians, translators, and visionaries. This is our Mandate:
- Drive greater Monero adoption and awareness through a variety of outreach-related activities; particularly public relations, education, and marketing.
- Respect the work done by the Core Developers and community workgroups, the founding principles of Monero, and the Monero ethos at all turns in the road so we do not jeopardize the integrity of what makes Monero great.
- Make the world a better place through Monero. We are motivated by the question: "How can we expect to prepare our children to live in this world, if we haven't prepared the world for our children”?
