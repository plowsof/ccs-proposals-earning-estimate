### The Proposal and Milestones

First of all, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks for your support and congratulate everyone on the New Year! I sincerely hope that the 2020 year will be as interesting and eventful as the previous, 2019 year.

So, my yet other 6 months of work have passed. I am not exaggerating if I say that a tremendous job has been done during this time. You can familiarize yourself with my progress reports in previous sentences.  

I want to outline only the main directions in the course of my work for the next six months, without going into unnecessary details and explanations (but, I will be glad to give comments on any points of interest to you):
- Accomplish the voiceover remaining performances of MoneroKon 2019  
- Finish the export of already completed translations of MRL research documents to TeX (followed by export to pdf)  
- Launch the Russian-language Wiki section with all reference and technical documentation and information (already in [progress](https://docs.xmr.ru/moneropedia/))  
- Start a translation of the CLI version of the wallet  
- Prepare the cycle of videos on working with the Trezor hardware wallet  
- Update all my Monero mining guides ([NVIDIA](https://xmr.ru/manuals/how-to-mine-monero-with-nvidia-gpu/) / [AMD](https://xmr.ru/manuals/how-to-mine-monero-with-amd-gpu/) / [CPU](https://xmr.ru/manuals/how-to-mine-monero-cpu/))  
- And the last, but not least, point in my to-do list for the new year is to continue working on the news block and other videos on the [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/MoneroRussianCommunity) as well as doing translations of everything related to Monero into the Russian language
