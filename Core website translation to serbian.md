This is a proposal to translate the core part of the website and filtering all the faulty translations out. By trasnlating this to Serbian it will have a slight impact to the bigger adaptation of Monero in Balkan.

I got an English C1 certificate and I am currently studying Japanese at the Faculty of philology. I believe that I am qualified enough to translate it by myself.

If everything goes well I will translate the rest of the site (Moneropoedia and userguides) and after that I will do a full Japanese translation.

This proposal includes one milestone: The checking and editing of faulty translations, after that finishing the rest of the page. 
7157 need checking and a lot of them will need editing. The left over 2,226 words will be translated after that. The job will be done ~4days.
A compensation of 3xmr should be fair enough.
