# Proposal

I will work for 25 hours per week over 3 months at a rate of 0.12 XMR / hour. At $130 / XMR (21 daily EMA) this makes 36 XMR (0.12 * 100 * 3).

*Note: After this period, Monero Observer will turn 1, marking 365 days of uninterrupted daily Monero news reporting. Thanks for being a loyal reader and supporter, I am very proud to be part of the best community out there.*
