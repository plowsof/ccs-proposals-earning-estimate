# Who?
Hi everyone, I'm HardenedSteel. I've been in Monero ecosystem and contributor for a couple of years. My previous contributions in the Monero ecosystem are:

* Maintenance of getmonero.org[1](https://github.com/monero-project/monero-site/issues?q=involves%3Ahardenedsteel)
* featherwallet.org[2](https://github.com/feather-wallet/feather-site/issues?q=involves%3Ahardenedsteel)
* revuo-xmr.com[3](https://github.com/rottenwheel/revuo-weekly/issues?q=involves%3Ahardenedsteel)
* Helping to newcomers on Reddit[4](https://www.reddit.com/user/HardenedSteelX/), Monero StackExchange[5](https://monero.stackexchange.com/users/12826/hardenedsteel), Monero.Town[6](https://monero.town/u/HardenedSteel) and helping them to onboard Monero ecosystem[7](https://github.com/HardenedSteel/Help4XMR)
* Translation of Monero.com (and Cake) Wallet[8](https://github.com/cake-tech/cake_wallet/pull/724).
* and more...

# What?
I will continue maintaining getmonero.org but with greater level. This will entail reviewing pull requests, fixing issues, adding new content and following social media (such as Reddit and Monero.town) to identify new issues and feature requests for those who do not use GitHub etc.

Furthermore, I will (attempt to) continue contributing to other Monero ecosystems in my spare time.

# Why?
Many people in Monero community (such as both core and non-core devs and people on social media) complains the website isn't maintained well and there are only a few people working on the site.

# Milestones
This proposal is only one month since it's my first proposal and requesting 5 XMR for it. Depending on the feedback from the community I'm planning work more than month.
