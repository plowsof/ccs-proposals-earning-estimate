Hello! Dr. Sarang Noether here, ready to continue full-time research, development, and analysis in privacy-focused cryptography and applications. You can read my previous monthly reports for [January](https://repo.getmonero.org/monero-project/ccs-proposals/-/merge_requests/110#note_8753) and [February](https://repo.getmonero.org/monero-project/ccs-proposals/-/merge_requests/110#note_9123) to see what I've been up to recently. A report for March is forthcoming at the end of this month.

This funding request covers the period from April through June 2020. There's plenty to do.
- CLSAG testing and deployment. The [CLSAG](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/654) signature construction has undergone major work on its security model, development, and testing to make it faster and safer. It's expected to undergo final external review and deployment.
- Triptych research and testing. The [Triptych](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/018) proving system has been revised and released as a preprint. Research continues on a more efficient version that looks promising.
- Protocol updates. Research is ongoing to determine safe and efficient ways to improve transaction privacy, fungibility, and functionality through things like improved multisignature support and cross-chain interactions.

And of course, there is always research and development that arises as we go. Expect code review, the usual updates and changes, outreach, literature review, proof-of-concept code and testing, documentation, and more.

I work hard to provide value in my research for the value provided here. As before, this request is for the equivalent of 10415 USD monthly, my assessment of fair market compensation for an independent Ph.D. researcher in the United States. Therefore, using a 7-day EMA of 48.80 USD/XMR from Kraken with a 10% buffer to account for recent major volatility, the request total is **704 XMR**. Further, note that this request will be paid in full as soon as it is funded, in order to reduce the effects of price fluctuations and ensure that contributed value is the value that reaches me.

Questions, comments, and feedback about this request are welcome.
