### What

- work on issues/ideas reported by users
- work on tasks listed on the [ideas](https://featherwallet.org/ideas/) page and [MAINTENANCE.md](https://github.com/feather-wallet/feather/blob/master/MAINTENANCE.md)
- upstream useful patches to monero core
- test and review pull requests (GUI/core)
- help out where I can

My primary focus for Q1 2024 is practical multisig UX.

### Who

Hi, I'm tobtoht. I am an active contributor to the Monero ecosystem since April 2018. Currently, I maintain Feather Wallet and contribute to the core codebase.

Previous CCS: https://ccs.getmonero.org/proposals/tobtoht-feather-dev-2023-3.html

### Proposal

Work for 480 hours at a rate of €45/h + 0.05 XMR/h. At €148 / XMR (14 day EMA) this makes 170 XMR.
