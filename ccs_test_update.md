## Update 

We're back! here is a brief summary of events before we get testing:

- After the [CCS wallet was drained](https://github.com/monero-project/meta/issues/916) a Vote was held to determine if luigi [should continue as an escrow](https://github.com/monero-project/meta/issues/935).
- Feedback obtained from the community determined how the new CCS wallet would be created/used in a secure manner;
    - A new, single-purpose, air-gapped laptop was purchased (bluetooth/wifi disabled).
    - The OS is Debian, and FeatherWallet will be used to sign and transport transaction files (via QR codes)
	- Special thanks to tobtoht of FeatherWallet who worked tirelessly to push out a new version with convenient air-gapped signing capabilities, and every community member who offered feedback on how to best move forward.
- The exact amount stolen + 21 XMR extra was sent to the General Fund ([X](https://twitter.com/WatchFund/status/1732391070216908886) / [nitter](https://nitter.net/WatchFund/status/1732391070216908886))
- The machine where the drained wallet resided is being [forensically anaylised](https://github.com/monero-project/meta/issues/923) to determine if it was compromised. 
- Luigi will escrow a temporary wallet until the [31st March 2024](https://github.com/monero-project/meta/issues/935#issuecomment-1867257410). 

We must now begin to prepare for a 'post March 31st CCS' and wish everyone a merry RandomX'mas and a happy new year! 

## Milestone 1

Lets test the new CCS wallet by raising approx ~$12.16 / 0.069XMR to subsidise transaction fees for several hundred consolidations/payouts for the next 3 months.
