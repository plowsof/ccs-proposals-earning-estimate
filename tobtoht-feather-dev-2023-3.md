This proposal is for 3 months of full time Feather Wallet development.

### What

- work on issues/ideas reported by users
- work on tasks listed on the [ideas](https://featherwallet.org/ideas/) page and [MAINTENANCE.md](https://github.com/feather-wallet/feather/blob/master/MAINTENANCE.md)
- upstream useful patches to monero core
- test and review pull requests (GUI/core)
- help out where I can

As always, I heavily prioritize user feedback when deciding what to focus on.

### Who

Hi, I'm tobtoht. I am an active contributor to the Monero ecosystem since April 2018. Currently, I maintain Feather Wallet and contribute to the core codebase.

Previous CCS: https://repo.getmonero.org/monero-project/ccs-proposals/-/merge_requests/376

Progress updates are posted to #feather:monero.social and /r/FeatherWallet.

### Proposal:

Work for 40 hours per week for the next 3 months at a rate of €45/h. At €148 / XMR (14 day EMA) this makes 146 XMR.
