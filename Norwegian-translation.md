Proposal: I downloaded the Monero GUI and realized that there is no Norwegian translation for it.
I am a certified translator who has translated for among others Facebook, and I would love to help translate the
GUI to Norwegian. To show my support for crypto and crypto adoption, I suggest doing it for a 60%-ish discount, so appr. $0.05/word.
There should be 3447 words, which amounts to, lets say, 3 XMR. I can assure you that it is my own intention to do a flawless job and I
also want the translation to be just right. I think it is important for the Monero community to have a Norwegian translation of the GUI 
as cryptocurrency is getting more and more traction in Norway, and I think Norwegians will benefit from having it in their native language.

Addendum:

I will personally handle the translation.
I have one milestone, which is translation of the 3447 words.
If approved, I will have the translation completed within 48 hours.
