# Introduction

Hi, everyone! [v1docq47](https://t.me/v1docq47) is here!

This is our next CCS proposal for the new winter period for voiceover of [Monerotopia 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcJiaPmldhQ&list=PLfJ_JjSwYaa810CWboNcPX7cY-JYEWo-4) and [Konferenco 2023](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsSYUeVwrHBm1m7IaU3JiDVb5EC7cn0KG) videos into Russian, creating other content for [Monero Russian Community Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@MoneroRussianCommunity) and supporting [Russian Monero website XMR.RU](https://xmr.ru/).

# Who I Am?

[Since 2017](https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Av1docq47+archived%3Afalse+is%3Aclosed+sort%3Acreated-asc) we've been working on translations and writing various articles and manuals about Monero in Russian.

We also create [news](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixUamqRd3nc&list=PLQyX7h187qnQWtCN6brBXsB9QLEuaJWQO) / [informational](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOsHxWG5jNs&list=PLQyX7h187qnTqq4_-EAnp4HZk9eJpMvZK) / [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bug2_NvHeNs&list=PLQyX7h187qnTGFHdrdZL7VRxQINEQZ2xJ) videos and make [Russian voiceovers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69Vszlx5PQ0&list=PLQyX7h187qnR3doOALJAmHv1mAVPNzNV9) of the key events happening in Monero Community and ecosystem.

Besides we are publishing text transcripts of all the talks both in Russian and English in a separate repository (similar to previous events like [Monero Konferenco 2022](https://github.com/v1docq47/monerokon-2022-transcriptions), [Critical Decentralisation Cluster (36c3)](https://github.com/v1docq47/monero-cdc-36c3-transcriptions), [Monerotopia 2022](https://github.com/v1docq47/monerotopia-2022-transcriptions), [Monerotopia 2022](https://github.com/v1docq47/monerotopia-2023-transcriptions/tree/main/transcriptions)) so that everyone could not only watch, but also read the text versions of the talks.

That is, we are doing localization of Monero project on Russian.

# What?

During the upcoming winter period we plan to accomplish the following milestones:
 
- continue (and, of course, to finish) voiceover of the remaining [Monerotopia 2023](https://trello.com/c/uygCrD2N/4-monerotopia-2023-on-russian-voiceover) videos
- to start the voiceover and making transcripts of [Konferenco 2023](https://trello.com/c/97JWtmIb/5-konferenco-2023-on-russian-voiceover) videos
- we are also planning to [launch a series of short videos](https://trello.com/c/B8mYhqH4/6-monero-tutorials-shorts) on working and interacting with Monero tools and wallets. The main idea behind this is to teach and show users that downloading, installing, mining, pruning the blockchain, sending and receiving transactions, etc. is simple. Just the key information, nothing superfluous
- we will continue to publish weekly and quarterly news releases, translate articles and all kind of materials related to Monero for XMR.RU and Moneropedia
 
As always, the whole process and progress will be displayed in our [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/UoHdgHLb/december-2023-may-2024).

# How much and Payouts

Because of the USD-RUB exchange rate, I reduced the price per hour to 12$.

12$ per hour, \~30 hours per week or \~120 hours per month (\~3-5 hours Ð° day)  
30-day average Monero price on Kraken \~165$ (on 05.11.2023)

## In total

52.2 XMR for 6 months work  
8.7 XMR per month starting from December
