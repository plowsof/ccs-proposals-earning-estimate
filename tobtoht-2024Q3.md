### What

- work on issues/ideas reported by users
- [maintain](https://github.com/feather-wallet/feather/blob/master/MAINTENANCE.md) and [improve](https://featherwallet.org/ideas/) feather
- upstream useful patches to monero core
- test and review pull requests (GUI/core)
- help out where I can

My primary focus for this period will be [reproducible/bootstrappable fcmp++ builds](https://github.com/monero-project/monero/pull/9440) (core) and finishing work on [multisig support](https://github.com/feather-wallet/feather/commit/f944b6e6f78a29abe910b8f1d5d88b7c783553d6) (feather).

### Who

Hi, I'm tobtoht. I am an active contributor to the Monero ecosystem since April 2018. Currently, I maintain Feather Wallet and contribute to the core codebase.

Previous CCS: https://repo.getmonero.org/monero-project/ccs-proposals/-/merge_requests/428

### Proposal

Work for 480 hours at a rate of €45/h + 0.05 XMR/h. At €139 / XMR (14 day EMA) this makes 179 XMR.
