I'm proposing to continue my part time work on Getmonero.org (monero-site repository), 20 hours a week for 3 more months.

## What
I will work on the website in the same terms as in [my last proposal](https://repo.getmonero.org/monero-project/ccs-proposals/-/merge_requests/111), so basically:

- Triaging issues
- Adding new functionalities according to the feedback of the community
- Increasing user friendliness
- Updating obsolete sections
- Improving localization process
- Bug fixes
- Reviews

I triage or review the vast majority of the [issues](https://repo.getmonero.org/monero-project/monero-site/-/issues) and merge requests on the monero-site repository. You can also see the list of my [past direct contributions](https://repo.getmonero.org/monero-project/monero-site/-/merge_requests?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=merged&author_username=erciccione) to have an idea of the work i do. I usually post updates about the website on reddit as well (see [the last one](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/fetf6z/getmoneroorg_updated_fixed_meta_tags_updated/)).

## Milestones
I'm proposing to work as developer on the monero-site repository for three months at a rate of €30/hour, starting on April 2020, 20 hours a week. This results in a total of *~~180 XMR~~* *~~167 XMR~~* *180 XMR* at the rate 1 XMR = ~~€40~~ ~~€43~~ €40.
