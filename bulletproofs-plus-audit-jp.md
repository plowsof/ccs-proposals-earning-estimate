I am opening this CCS proposal on behalf of JP Aumasson for a second audit of Bulletproofs+. Payout will be to him directly in XMR. Bulletproofs+ make Monero transactions faster and more efficient.

JP's SoW: https://github.com/monero-project/meta/files/6037185/bpplus-review-sow.pdf
First audit from ZenGo: https://suyash67.github.io/homepage/assets/pdfs/bulletproofs_plus_audit_report_v1.1.pdf

JP will build upon the previous audit and code changes resulting from it. Audits are critical for Monero's code security. Bulletproofs+ are a drop-in replacement for Bulletproofs, and they will remain useful for future Monero improvements like Triptych.

I would like to thank the companies who submitted a SoW for this second audit. I would also like to thank the other members of the Monero Audit Workgroup, who coordinated an audit with companies entirely on its own for the first time.

JP is available effectively immediately after the CCS funds are raised to begin the audit.

Cost breakdown:

* Audit amount: $12,500
* Buffer (10%): $1,250
* Total: $13,750
* XMR ($205): 67
