Hello, my dear followers, colleagues, and friends!  
v1docq47 is here!  
And this is my new funding request for my work.

### Who?

I am [v1docq47](https://t.me/v1docq47), member of [XMR.RU](https://xmr.ru/) team.  
Since September 2017 I translate into Russian everything related to Monero. Iâ€™m doing Russian dubbing and creating various videos about Monero for [Monero Russian Community YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChZc5PLsbP5zeFrmOYMKGmA).  
I active contributor in [Monero Localization](https://taiga.getmonero.org/profile/v1docq47) and [Monero Outreach](https://taiga.getmonero.org/profile/v1docq47) working groups.

### What?

Localization of the Monero project into Russian.  
Creation of information / news and tutorials video for YouTube channel.  

### The Proposal and Milestones

I want to reconsider the concept of videos which get to the Monero Russian Community YouTube and make them better - redraw animations, make the video more interesting from a visual point. Put it simply, I want to improve the quality of the content that we produce.

One of the main goals for this period of work for me will be the translation and voice-over of speeches from the first annual meeting Monero Konferenco 2019.

Additionally, I intend to finish the work over papers Monero Research Lab and transcriptions Breaking Monero and post them in the library on our new website [docs.xmr.ru](https://docs.xmr.ru).  
What would my translations papers MRL meet the standards, I plan to transfer them to the TeX system.  
It will be a brand-new experience in my practice.

Now that Monero wallet fully supports the work with the two most popular hardware wallets, precisely with Trezor and Ledger, I had an idea to make a separate video devoted to setup and working Monero GUI / CLI with the given hardware wallets.  
I tried to reach out to the official representatives of Trezor and Ledger and ask them to give me test samples of their wallets so that I could create guides / videos on working with these wallets within Monero.  
I even promised to return their after all the materials be ready, but they did not answer me...  
But, it is not a big deal! I will buy these hardware wallets myself, and once all the material is finished, I will just gift them to the participants Monero Russian community.

Apart from that, I will continue my work over translations of new articles and materials within the scope of the economy and ecosystem Monero.

### How much and Payouts
