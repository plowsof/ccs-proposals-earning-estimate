Hey Everyone,

After receiving the communityâ€™s feedback, we're excited to announce our revised proposal: two videos, one explainer about FCMP (Full-Chain Membership Proofs) and a remake of the outdated "What is Monero?" video. This will be our 4th and 5th video for the Monero CCS. 

Our previous videos covering core Monero concepts like Tail Emission, the importance of running a node, and RandomX have been informative, engaging, and uploaded on Getmonero.org, shared across X and YouTube. We believe that visual learning and breaking down complex ideas into digestible formats are highly effective, and we aim to do the same with FCMP and the introductory video.

Although we haven't finalized the script yet for the FCMP video, we're committed to delivering a high-quality video approximately 2-3 minutes long, or however long it needs to be to effectively explain the concept. We're proposing a budget of 20 XMR for this video. This is slightly higher than our initial proposal since we agreed to extend the scope to include both dark and light backgrounds. As before, Xenu will assist with the script and storyboard, with 5 XMR allocated for his contribution. Additionally, we've reached out to kayabaNerve (Luke Parker) for fact-checking the script to ensure accuracy, and he's agreed to help us. A big thanks to him for his support.

Additionally, we have been approached and encouraged to refresh the introductory video on the website about "What is Monero?". The current information is outdated and incorrect, and the visuals could definitely be improved. This is the first video people who visit the website will watch, and it likely has the most views of any Monero video. We are ready to refresh the script, update the technical information to ensure accuracy, and make the branding cohesive with the other animated explainer videos we have created through the Monero CCS, all of which have already been uploaded to the Getmonero website. We are seeking 13 XMR to complete this part of the proposal. 

As always, we will open-source our project materials after completion.
We believe we've done a good job of gathering the community's feedback so far in our previous proposals, and we'll continue to do so by posting our script and storyboards on Matrix and here in the repo.

If anyone has any questions or suggestions, please feel free to chime in.

Thanks!
