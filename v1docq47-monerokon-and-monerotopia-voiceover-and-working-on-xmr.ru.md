# Introduction

Due to [disallow on posting new CCS to translate](https://github.com/monero-project/meta/issues/732) on ccs.getmonero.org, I redid [my previous CCS proposal](https://repo.getmonero.org/monero-project/ccs-proposals/-/merge_requests/329) and removed the translate part of the work.

# Who I Am?

I am [v1docq47](https://github.com/v1docq47), active contributor [Monero Localization](https://translate.getmonero.org/user/v1docq47/) and [Monero Outreach](https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/outreach-docs/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+v1docq47) workgroups.  
[More than 5 years](https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Av1docq47+archived%3Afalse+is%3Aclosed+sort%3Acreated-asc) I have been translating into Russian. Also, I am a [moderator, designer and developer](https://github.com/xmr-ru/xmr_ru/commits/main) of the largest news and information website about Monero in the Russian-speaking segment - [XMR.RU](https://xmr.ru/) and [Unofficial Russian technical documentation for Monero](https://wiki.xmr.ru/).  
Also I and my wife doing Russian voiceover and creating various videos about Monero for [Monero Russian Community YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChZc5PLsbP5zeFrmOYMKGmA).
